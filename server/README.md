# Game On! Server

## Getting started

For local backend dev you will need: 

1. VS Code
1. Git CLI
1. .NET Core 3.1
1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
1. [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)
1. [DAPR VS Code Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dapr)

Then run these commands in a terminal:

```powershell
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/DanielLarsenNZ/gameon.git
cd gameon

# Init Dapr local *Must run as Admin / sudo
dapr init
```

## Run local

A helper script to run all services locally is provided. Dapr must be initialised and running in Docker (Docker desktop).

    cd /deploy
    ./run-dapr-local.ps1

## Debug local

You can debug the services locally in VS Code by following this article: [Debugging Dapr applications with Visual Studio Code](https://blog.ehn.nu/2020/03/debugging-dapr-applications-with-visual-studio-code/)

The VS Code `launch.json` and `tasks.json` files are included in this repo. To open the workspace correctly, cd into the server/GameOn folder before opening VS Code, e.g.

    cd server/GameOn
    code .

## Creating a new Service

Each service is a new Visual Studio ASP.NET Core project. It is easiest to create new services in Visual Studio (Community, Developer or Enterprise). 

1. Add a new ASP.NET Core API Project, e.g. `GameOn.(NewServiceName)`
1. Add project references to `GameOn.Common`, `GameOn.CommonCore`

Use another service project as a template and:

1. Copy nuget references
1. Clone Startup.cs
1. Create a new empty API Controller
1. Create new Models in `GameOn.Common` project, in the Models folder, but change namespace back to `GameOn.Common`
1. Implement a Service

Before you run locally you will need to:

1. Add new lines to `/deploy/run-dapr-local.ps1` to build and run the Service. Choose a new unused port for the new service.
1. Update `Properties/launchSettings.json` to only startup on HTTP and to use the port you chose in the previous step. See [How to change the port number for Asp.Net core app?]
