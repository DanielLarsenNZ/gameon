# New user workflow

1. Use MSAL to obtain a token
1. POST with token in header and no body to https://api.gameon.nz/me. 
   1. If the User already exists in GameOn the endpoint will return `200 OK` with the User in the response body. The User will not be updated.
   1. If the User does not already exist, the endpoint will create a User in GameOn using the AAD profile information contained in the claims of the token. Then will return `201 Created` with the User in the response body.

An example using VSCode Rest client:

    @accessToken = eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...

    ### POST User
    POST https://api.gameon.nz/me
    Authorization: Bearer {{accessToken}}

And the response:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

* `id` is a SHA256 Hash of the User's AAD Object Id (in upper-case)
* Tenant Id is not returned as it is retrieved from the User's claims

## Join a Tournament

`POST /tournaments/players` takes an array of User Ids in the body. Any User Id that is not found in the collection of Players on the Tournament will cause the User with that Id to be copied into the Tournament's Players collection. Note that Players is a Collection of Users.

    ### Add Players to Tournament
    POST http://api.gameon.nz/tournaments/04022d7e841f46d58f7b056b5d18e6d3/players
